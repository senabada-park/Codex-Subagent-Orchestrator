# Codex Subagent Orchestrator

`codex-subagent-orchestrator` is a workspace-local skill for supervising one or more `codex exec` workers from a parent Codex session.

It is designed for tasks where the parent should stay in supervisor mode, split work into bounded worker runs, preserve execution evidence, and accept results only after validation.

## What It Does

- Interprets `/sub ...` requests as explicit delegation requests.
- Chooses a small worker team based on task shape.
- Supports sequential and parallel worker execution.
- Keeps worker prompts bounded with explicit writable scope and validation rules.
- Preserves prompt files, manifests, summaries, and per-run evidence for later review.
- Enforces safer delivery patterns such as read-only final review after writable work.

## Repository Layout

```text

|-- AGENTS.md
`-- skills/
    `-- codex-subagent-orchestrator/
        |-- SKILL.md
        |-- agents/openai.yaml
        |-- assets/spec-templates/
        |-- references/
        `-- scripts/start-codex-subagent-team.ps1
```

## Requirements

- A Codex environment with `codex exec` available on `PATH`
- PowerShell
- A workspace where local skills under `./skills` are supported

This repository is already arranged as a Codex workspace. The root `AGENTS.md` wires `/sub` requests to the local orchestrator skill.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository

```powershell
git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
cd Codex-Subagent-Orchestrator-main
```

### 2. Use the chat entrypoint

In Codex chat, start a request with `/sub`:

```text
/sub create a small CLI todo app with one implementer and one reviewer
```

The parent Codex session should:

- switch into supervisor mode
- form a bounded worker team
- run workers with `codex exec`
- validate the result before reporting back

### 3. Or run the launcher directly

Copy one of the bundled spec templates into the workspace root and execute it with the PowerShell launcher:

```powershell
Copy-Item `
  ".\skills\codex-subagent-orchestrator\assets\spec-templates\minimal-write.template.json" `
  ".\minimal-write.json"

& ".\skills\codex-subagent-orchestrator\scripts\start-codex-subagent-team.ps1" `
  -SpecPath ".\minimal-write.json" `
  -AsJson
```

The template uses:

- `cwd: "."`
- `cwd_resolution: "invocation"`

That means the launcher resolves the worker workspace from the directory where you run the command.

## Bundled Example Specs

The repository includes reusable JSON specs under `skills/codex-subagent-orchestrator/assets/spec-templates/`:

- `minimal-write.template.json`: one sequential writer that creates a bounded file
- `parallel-two-files.template.json`: two independent writers running in parallel
- `implementer-reviewer.template.json`: one implementer followed by a read-only reviewer
- `parallel-implementers-reviewer.template.json`: two parallel implementers followed by a read-only reviewer
- `nested-root-safety.template.json`: workspace root resolution and nested-run safety validation

These templates are intended as launcher and workflow examples, not domain examples such as crawlers or games.

## Launcher Command Pattern

Use the bundled PowerShell launcher when you want repeatable worker orchestration from JSON:

```powershell
& ".\skills\codex-subagent-orchestrator\scripts\start-codex-subagent-team.ps1" `
  -SpecPath ".\your-spec.json" `
  -AsJson
```

Top-level fields commonly used in a spec:

- `cwd`
- `output_dir`
- `manifest_file`
- `execution_mode`
- `requested_deliverables`
- `supervisor_only`
- `require_final_read_only_review`
- `material_issue_strategy`
- `defaults`
- `agents`

For deliverable-oriented `/sub` workflows, prefer:

- `supervisor_only: true`
- `require_final_read_only_review: true`
- `material_issue_strategy: "fixer_then_rereview"`

## Minimal Spec Example

```json
{
  "cwd": ".",
  "cwd_resolution": "invocation",
  "output_dir": "subagent-runs/minimal-write",
  "skip_git_repo_check": true,
  "execution_mode": "sequential",
  "write_prompt_files": true,
  "write_summary_file": true,
  "shared_directive_mode": "reference",
  "defaults": {
    "model": "gpt-5.4",
    "sandbox": "workspace-write",
    "reasoning_effort": "low"
  },
  "agents": [
    {
      "name": "probe-writer",
      "task": "Create or replace launcher-probe.txt in the working directory containing exactly the text OK.",
      "writable_scope": ["launcher-probe.txt"],
      "validation": [
        "Ensure launcher-probe.txt exists.",
        "Ensure the file content is exactly OK."
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Output Artifacts

A healthy run typically produces:

- worker stdout and stderr files
- one prompt file per worker
- one `last.txt` file per worker unless overridden
- `orchestration-manifest.json`
- `orchestration-summary.md`
- an optional per-run archive with copied deliverables and worker evidence

By default, examples write outputs under `subagent-runs/`.

## How the Skill Is Intended to Work

Parent Codex responsibilities:

- classify the request
- decide team size and worker roles
- choose model, sandbox, and reasoning effort
- keep worker boundaries narrow
- validate outputs
- rerun review after any bounded fix

Worker responsibilities:

- complete one bounded task
- stay within writable scope
- validate their own result
- return a compact summary
- stop after success criteria are met

## Documentation Map

- `skills/codex-subagent-orchestrator/SKILL.md`: skill overview and operating rules
- `skills/codex-subagent-orchestrator/references/orchestration-workflow.md`: parent/worker workflow and team patterns
- `skills/codex-subagent-orchestrator/references/sub-command-protocol.md`: `/sub` behavior contract
- `skills/codex-subagent-orchestrator/references/spec-format.md`: JSON launcher spec format
- `skills/codex-subagent-orchestrator/references/testing-playbook.md`: recommended test order and validation checklist

## Typical Use Cases

- delegate a bounded implementation task to one worker
- run multiple independent workers in parallel
- separate implementation from review
- preserve reproducible evidence for delivery and audit
- recover with a bounded fixer and re-review instead of rerunning a whole team

## Notes

- This repository ships orchestration examples, not full product examples.
- Reviewers and validators should default to `read-only`.
- `danger-full-access` should be reserved for cases where workspace-write is genuinely insufficient.
- If the launcher path fails, keep the failed spec and pivot to direct `codex exec` with explicit model and reasoning settings.
