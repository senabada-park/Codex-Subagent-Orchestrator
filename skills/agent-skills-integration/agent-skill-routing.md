# Agent Skills Routing

This workspace vendors the full upstream `addyosmani/agent-skills` repository under `vendor/agent-skills/`.

Use the vendor pack as an execution-discipline layer, not as a replacement for local orchestration.

Precedence order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. local parent or `/sub` orchestration rules
3. this routing file
4. vendored upstream skills, agents, references, and command files

If an upstream skill conflicts with local approval, writable-scope, parent-landing, or evidence rules, the local workspace rules win.

## Shared Mandatory Plan-First Contract

For this shared gate specifically, this routing file is the canonical local policy source. Parent-session and `/sub` skills should inherit and operationalize this gate, not replace it with a conflicting parallel authority.

For every coding request that could lead to code generation, code edits, implementation instructions, or writable execution, require this order with no exceptions:

1. give a short natural-language understanding report
2. ask for explicit user approval to proceed
3. apply `skills/plan-mode-default/SKILL.md` and complete the planning contract from `skills/plan-mode-default/references/coding-plan-prompt-en.md`
4. write or update the approved full plan as a versioned Markdown record under `plan/`
5. only then begin implementation, fix work, or launch writable coding workers

This applies to new features, bug fixes, refactors, direct edit requests, "do it now" requests, urgent requests, tiny fixes, repair steps, and follow-up change requests. In this workspace, treat every such coding request as an explicit request for the plan-first flow before implementation begins.

Do not treat blanket authority, urgency, "proceed immediately", or small scope as a waiver of this gate. No coding subtask, tiny follow-up edit, repair step, or seemingly trivial implementation action may proceed unless it is already covered by the active approved plan record or has been re-planned and approved.

The active plan file under `plan/` is a living delivery record, not a one-time dump. Use a time-sortable filename, clearly mark the plan type, version, status, and current progress, and keep that same document updated after every planning-turn change, every writable task step, and every status-changing verification, review, repair, or acceptance step so it always shows what is complete, incomplete, in progress, blocked, superseded, or next.

For any coding request, treat the local `plan` phase as mandatory before `implement`, `fix`, `/sub` implementer routing, or any writable execution. Do not let urgency, tiny scope, or direct implementation language bypass the local plan-first approval gate.

## Parent-Session Phase Routing

### `scan`

Default:

- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/using-agent-skills/SKILL.md`
- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/context-engineering/SKILL.md`

When the request is vague or still forming:

- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/idea-refine/SKILL.md`
- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/spec-driven-development/SKILL.md`

### `plan`

Default:

- `skills/plan-mode-default/SKILL.md`
- `skills/plan-mode-default/references/coding-plan-prompt-en.md` when present; treat it as the local default planning contract unless the user explicitly overrides its format while preserving the understanding-report and explicit-approval gate
- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/planning-and-task-breakdown/SKILL.md`

Add when the plan needs explicit slice ordering or incremental rollout discipline:

- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/incremental-implementation/SKILL.md`

When interface, schema, or contract design matters:

- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/api-and-interface-design/SKILL.md`

When launch, migration, pipeline, or documentation work is part of the plan:

- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/ci-cd-and-automation/SKILL.md`
- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/deprecation-and-migration/SKILL.md`
- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/documentation-and-adrs/SKILL.md`
- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/shipping-and-launch/SKILL.md`

### `implement`

Use this phase only after the local plan-first approval gate has been satisfied.

Default:

- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/incremental-implementation/SKILL.md`
- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md`

Task-shaped add-ons:

- browser or app UI work:
  - `vendor/agent-skills/skills/frontend-ui-engineering/SKILL.md`
- boundary or API work:
  - `vendor/agent-skills/skills/api-and-interface-design/SKILL.md`
- workflow, git, or release-surface changes:
  - `vendor/agent-skills/skills/git-workflow-and-versioning/SKILL.md`
  - `vendor/agent-skills/skills/ci-cd-and-automation/SKILL.md`
- migration-heavy work:
  - `vendor/agent-skills/skills/deprecation-and-migration/SKILL.md`

### `verify`

Default:

- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/debugging-and-error-recovery/SKILL.md`
- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md`

Task-shaped add-ons:

- browser runtime validation:
  - `vendor/agent-skills/skills/browser-testing-with-devtools/SKILL.md`
- security-sensitive surfaces:
  - `vendor/agent-skills/skills/security-and-hardening/SKILL.md`
- performance-sensitive surfaces:
  - `vendor/agent-skills/skills/performance-optimization/SKILL.md`

### `review`

Default:

- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/performance-optimization/SKILL.md`
- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/documentation-and-adrs/SKILL.md`
- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/git-workflow-and-versioning/SKILL.md`

### `fix`, `re-verify`, `re-review`

Default:

- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/debugging-and-error-recovery/SKILL.md`
- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md`
- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/code-review-and-quality/SKILL.md`

- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/security-and-hardening/SKILL.md`
- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/performance-optimization/SKILL.md`
- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/code-simplification/SKILL.md`

## Release-Only Overlay

This is not part of the default parent phase checklist.

Use it only when the task genuinely includes release work or an explicit shipping step:

- `vendor/agent-skills/skills/git-workflow-and-versioning/SKILL.md`

## `/sub` Worker Routing

### Planner / Planner-Like

Default:

- `skills/plan-mode-default/SKILL.md`

- testing:
  - `vendor/agent-skills/references/testing-patterns.md`
- security:
  - `vendor/agent-skills/references/security-checklist.md`
- performance:
  - `vendor/agent-skills/references/performance-checklist.md`
- accessibility:
  - `vendor/agent-skills/references/accessibility-checklist.md`

## Integration Rules

- do not inline all 20 skills into one prompt
- select only the minimum set that materially sharpens the current phase or worker
- when multiple imported skills overlap, prefer the phase-appropriate core skill and add specialized ones only when the task surface justifies them
- use imported anti-rationalization and verification sections as execution discipline, but keep local approval, parent-landing, evidence, and bounded-fix-loop rules in charge

## Selection Algorithm

Use this deterministic selection order so the vendor pack stays meaningfully integrated without turning into prompt bloat.

1. write the active judgment criteria first:
   - dominant technical surfaces
   - acceptance risks
   - verification burdens
   - review burdens
2. start with the role or phase default skill set from this file
3. add task-shaped implementation skills only when one of those criteria says the extra discipline is needed
4. add specialist overlays or checklists only when the acceptance risk genuinely requires that extra lens
5. do not attach launch, migration, CI, browser, security, performance, or documentation skills unless the task actually touches that surface
6. keep expanding only while each added imported skill changes behavior, validation, or acceptance in a way the parent can explain
7. if two imported skills say nearly the same thing, keep the one that matches the current phase or worker role more directly
8. stop when the next imported skill adds breadth but not meaningful signal

Quick defaults:

- planner: `skills/plan-mode-default/SKILL.md` + `skills/plan-mode-default/references/coding-plan-prompt-en.md` + `using-agent-skills` + `planning-and-task-breakdown`; add `context-engineering` when repo context selection matters and `spec-driven-development` when the task boundary or contract is still forming
- implementer: `incremental-implementation` + `test-driven-development`; add exactly one surface skill for UI, API, CI, git, or migration when needed
- fixer: `debugging-and-error-recovery` + `test-driven-development`; add `incremental-implementation` only when the repair needs staged rewrite discipline, then add one specialist skill only when the finding is clearly security, performance, or simplification related
- reviewer: `code-review-and-quality`; add one specialist overlay or checklist only when the requested acceptance bar explicitly includes it
- validator: `test-driven-development` + `debugging-and-error-recovery`; add one runtime or specialist verification skill only when the task surface requires it
