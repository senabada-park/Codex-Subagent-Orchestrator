# `/sub` Command Protocol

Treat `/sub` as a request for supervised internal delegation.

If the runtime cannot provide the required internal agent tools, do not invent delegated workers. State that `/sub` delegation is unavailable in this runtime, fall back to a parent-only execution path, and keep the same plan-first and evidence-preservation rules.

## Parse

- strip the `/sub` prefix
- treat the remaining text as the actual task request
- keep any explicit user constraints, deadlines, review requirements, or tool limitations

## Plan First

Before any worker starts, the parent must decide:

- whether one worker is enough or whether a team is justified
- whether execution should be serial, parallel, or mixed
- whether the work should stay inside one issue-sized run or become an in-session queue
- which workers need write access
- where review belongs
- which imported vendor skills each phase or worker actually needs

For any coding request, the parent must also activate the shared gate defined in `skills/agent-skills-integration/agent-skill-routing.md`, deliver the short understanding report required by `skills/plan-mode-default/SKILL.md` and `skills/plan-mode-default/references/coding-plan-prompt-en.md`, and obtain explicit user approval before any writable worker can launch.
For coding requests, the parent must write or update the approved full PLAN under repo-root `plan/` before any writable worker can launch.
For coding requests, the parent must keep that active plan file updated so it clearly shows plan type, version, status, completion state, completed work, remaining work, blockers, and next step as the run progresses.
For coding requests, the parent must keep `orchestration-plan.md`, `status.md`, and the active file under `plan/` aligned on the same active plan path, version, and current status.

## Mandatory Pre-Launch Report

Report this to the user before launch:

- request summary
- user constraints
- delegation justification
- approval status and reason
- planned worker count
- execution mode: serial | parallel | mixed
- each worker id, role, mission, writable scope, model, reasoning effort, and stage
- reviewer or validator timing or policy
- acceptance strategy
- approved plan file path in `plan/` for coding runs
- plan artifact type, version, and current status for coding runs
- evidence paths on disk

For coding runs, the worker topology may be provisional before the approval gate and should be finalized only after the understanding report and coding direction have been explicitly approved.
For coding requests, always pause first for explicit approval of the understanding report and coding direction. After that gate is satisfied, finalize delegation justification, worker count, execution mode, per-worker assignments, and the rest of the pre-launch report before writable worker launch. Blanket authority or explicit proceed-now language do not waive this gate.

## Approval Skip Conditions

Skip the pause only for non-coding runs, or for execution pacing after the mandatory coding plan-first gate has already been satisfied, when one of these is true:

- the user clearly delegated blanket authority for the run
- the user explicitly said to proceed immediately

Ambiguous urgency is not enough.

These skip conditions never override the mandatory plan-first gate for coding requests and never allow writable coding work to start before the understanding report has been approved.

## Adaptive Team Rules

Use one implementer when:

- the task is narrow
- the writable surface is shared or nested
- one change depends on another
- a single contract is likely to be touched from multiple sides

Use multiple implementers only when:

- writable surfaces are independent
- outputs can merge without negotiation
- the parent can land accepted changes into the primary workspace without ambiguity
- final acceptance can still be handled by one read-only reviewer or validator

## Adaptive Review Rules

Default to one late read-only reviewer or validator.

Move review earlier only when:

- risk justifies an intermediate gate
- a parallel branch merge needs reconciliation
- a bounded fixer gate is cheaper than a broad rerun

Do not add a reviewer after every writer.

Suppress redundant final reviewers and validators when one acceptance pass is enough.

## Model And Reasoning Rules

Choose model and reasoning only after the plan exists.

Base the choice on:

- ambiguity
- failure cost
- writable scope
- dependency depth
- verification burden
- review burden

Choose from the internal agent capabilities available in the active session. Do not rely on repository-local hardcoded model catalogs or fallback priority lists.

## Imported Skill Selection Rules

Choose imported vendor skills only after role, writable scope, and review timing are fixed.

Use this adaptive algorithm:

1. write down the active judgment criteria first:
   - dominant technical surfaces
   - acceptance risks
   - verification burdens
   - review burdens
2. start with the role core from `skills/agent-skills-integration/agent-skill-routing.md`
3. add task-shaped skills only when one of the written criteria says the worker needs that extra discipline
4. add risk-shaped skills only when acceptance genuinely depends on that extra risk lens
5. keep expanding only while each added imported skill changes behavior, validation, or acceptance in a way the parent can explain
6. stop when the next imported skill would only restate an already-covered behavior or check

Do not attach every plausible imported skill by habit.
Do not enforce a rigid small cap either. Use as many imported skills as the active criteria justify, and no more.
If the parent cannot explain why a selected imported skill changes the worker's behavior or acceptance bar, remove it.

## Status Rules

The parent must keep reporting during execution.

Each status update should say:

- current stage
- active agents
- waiting agents
- completed agents
- failed agents
- what active agents are working on
- whether the run is blocked on approval, verification, or review

## Acceptance Rules

Accept only when:

- requested deliverables are present
- accepted writable worker outputs have been landed in the primary workspace
- promised checks have passed
- promised reviewer or validator verdicts have been captured
- evidence files are updated

If a review finding exceeds the current bounded repair plan, re-plan or re-approve instead of silently widening the fix.

## Material Issue Threshold

Treat a finding as material when any of the following is true:

- a requested deliverable is missing or incorrect
- a promised check failed
- a reviewer or validator cannot accept the artifact
- the repair would cross the approved writable scope
- parallel branch outputs cannot be merged deterministically
- the finding introduces security, rollback, or contract risk that changes acceptance

Do not burn a fixer loop on cosmetic-only observations that do not affect acceptance.
